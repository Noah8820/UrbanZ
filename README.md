#urbanZ
urbanZ should create a website for our imaginary clothing brand. The website should be operated with a frontend and backend.

We have divided the work among ourselves as follows:
Ilija: 	Backend
Ruben:	Backend
Noah: 	Frontend

##Must-have goals:
The website must be viewable and functional.

##Optional goals:
It should also be connected to a backend that manages the number of items and login.

#Timemanagement
We have 3.5 working days for this project, as we are all going on vacation soon and we still have trial days.
